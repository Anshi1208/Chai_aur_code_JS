# 30 Days JavaScript Challenge

Welcome to my repository for the [30 Days JavaScript Challenge]("https://courses.chaicode.com/learn/home/30-days-of-Javascript-challenge/30-days-javascript-challenge/section/515627/lesson/3197208"), led by Hitesh Chaudhary sir. In this challenge, I tackle a new JavaScript task every day for 30 days to enhance my coding skills and deepen my understanding of JavaScript.

## Overview

Each day, a new task is provided that focuses on various JavaScript concepts, including but not limited to:
- Algorithms
- Data Structures
- DOM Manipulation
- ES6 Features
- Asynchronous Programming

I solve these tasks and push my solutions to this repository. You can track my progress and see how my skills evolve throughout the challenge.
